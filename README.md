# hello-world
did this for an assignment

I am 20 years old. My favorite animal is an elephant. My favorite color is pink. I have always been a lover for the arts. I like the summers and the warm weather the most. Being outside is big for me, but I would stay inside for a good movie.

I have gone through alot of changes over this year. Mainly becoming responsible and working on time management. I have been getting alot better at that.
